# COMS 309 Project

A collaborative mobile game project built for **COMS 309: Software Development Practices** at Iowa State University.

This repo serves as a personal archive of the project with emphasis on my contributions to the **frontend development**.

## Project Overview

**Insatiable Insatiable Inchworms** is a competitive, real-time mobile game inspired by *Hungry Hungry Hippos*. Players compete by collecting balls, equipping cosmetics, and climbing the leaderboard. The app features:

- A fully functional multiplayer system with WebSocket-based club and global chat.
- Cosmetic skins and a marketplace to buy/sell items with in-game currency.
- Persistent user data with achievements and progression tracking.

## My Role: Frontend Developer

I was one of four developers and focused entirely on the frontend Android development using **Java**, **XML**, and the **Android SDK**. My specific contributions include:

- **Bottom Navigation View**: Designed and implemented navigation for key screens (Home, Marketplace, Cosmetics, Leaderboard, Club Chat).
- **Skins & Marketplace UI**: Built dynamic UI components using `RecyclerView` to display available skins and real-time market updates.
- **Achievements Screen**: Created an achievements system with tiered progress and dynamic display logic (including Roman numeral levels and color-coded tiers).
- **Club Chat & Global Chat**: Integrated WebSocket chat with message rendering, achievement display badges, and reporting tools.
- **Sign-Up & Settings Flow**: Developed the sign-up activity with form validation, a hidden SSN field (Easter egg-style), and account deletion logic.
- **End-to-End Espresso Tests**: Implemented full UI testing using Espresso for features like Sign Up, Market transactions, Club Chat interactions, and Settings/account deletion.
