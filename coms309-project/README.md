## My Role: Frontend Developer

I was one of four developers and focused entirely on the frontend Android development using **Java**, **XML**, and the **Android SDK**. My specific contributions include:

- **Bottom Navigation View**: Designed and implemented navigation for key screens (Home, Marketplace, Cosmetics, *Leaderboard, Club Chat).
- **Skins & Marketplace UI**: Built dynamic UI components using `RecyclerView` to display available skins and real-time market updates.
- **Achievements Screen**: Created an achievements system with tiered progress and dynamic display logic (including Roman numeral levels and color-coded tiers).
- **Club Chat & Global Chat**: Integrated WebSocket chat with message rendering, achievement display badges, and reporting tools.
- **Sign-Up & Settings Flow**: Developed the sign-up activity with form validation, a hidden SSN field, and account deletion logic.
- **End-to-End Espresso Tests**: Implemented full UI testing using Espresso for features like Sign Up, Market transactions, Club Chat interactions, and Settings/account deletion.
